Sve is a community-driven enumeration tool for vulnerable service configurations (and vulnerabilities hopefully soon).

Whether you're new to system hardening or a veteran system administrator, sve is here to make sure you don't have configurations that probably shouldn't be set on your blue team box or company servers.


## Services
Currently, covered services include:
* `FTP`
